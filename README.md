This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language with infinite field.

The field is represented as a sparse 2D array of blocks.

Started as a reimplementation of a prototype of the same idea in python: [insolor/game-of-life](https://github.com/insolor/game-of-life)
